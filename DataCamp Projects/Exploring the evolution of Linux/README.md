Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich evolution information about a software project. In this project, we'll read in, clean up and visualize a real world Git repository dataset of the Linux kernel. With almost 700k commits and thousands of contributors, there are some little data cleaning and wrangling challenges that we'll encounter. we'll also gain insights about the development activities over the last 13 years.
